                <p><strong>Goal:</strong>A program that estimates the value
                    of the<em>percolation threshold</em>
                    via Monte Carlo simulation. This program is a model that
                    can be applied to
                    real-life purposes, such as: given a porous landscape
                    with water on the surface (or oil below),
                    under what conditions will the water be able to drain
                    through to the bottom (or the oil to
                    gush through to the surface)? </p>

                <p> <strong>Details:</strong>The Monte Carlo simulation
                    consists of two conditions:
                    1) intializing all sites to be blocked. 2) repeating
                    the following until the system percolates:
                    choose a site uniformly at random among all blocked
                    sites; then open that site.
                    The fraction of opened sites when the system percolates
                    provides an estimate of the
                    percolation threshold. </p>

            </li>
            <p> <strong> Goal:</strong>Built a program in collaboration with
                a classmate that performs the function of
                auto-completion
                employed by modern applications, such as web browsers.</p>
            <p><strong> Details:</strong> Given a prefix, the program finds
                all queries that start with the given prefix and
                predicts how likely it is that the user is typing each query,
                presenting to the user a list of the top-matching queries in
                descending order of weight. This was
                implemented by sorting the terms by query string; binary
                searching to find all query strings that start with
                a given prefix; and sorting the matching terms by weight.
                The weight indicates how likely
                a word is the one that the user intends to write.</p>

                <p style="color:rgb(14, 14, 183)"> <strong> WordNet</strong> </p>
            </li>
            <p><strong> Goal:</strong> To measure the relatedness of two nouns
                using the WordNet diagraph.</p>
            <p> <strong> Details: </strong> Wordnet groups words into sets of
                synonyms called <em> synsets</em>. It also describes semantic
                relationships between synsets, such as connecting a hyponym (more specific
                synset) to a hypernym (more general synset). For example, the
                hyponym synset {gate, logic gate} is a hypernym of {AND circuit, AND
                gate} because an AND gate is a type of logic gate.
                The built WordNet diagraph has
                each vertex v as an integer that represents a synset, and each directed
                edge v --> w represents that w is a hypernym of v. The diagraph is a
                <em>rooted DAG</em>, which means that it is acyclic and has
                one vertex - the root - that is an ancestor of
                every other vertex. However, it is not
                necessarily a tree because a synset can have more than one hypernym.

                <p style="color:rgb(14, 14, 183)"> <strong>Seam Carving </strong> </p>
            </li>
            <p> <strong> Goal:</strong> Implement a content-aware image resizing
                algorithm. This algorithm is a core feature in Adobe Photoshop
                and other computer graphics applications.</p>
            <p> <strong> Details:</strong> To resize images without significantly
                losing the picture quality, this program preserves the most important
                features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc) of the image.
                It accomplishes doing so by: 1) computing the energy of every pixel
                in the image, using the dual-gradient energy function; 2) finding a
                vertical or horizontal seam with minimum energy. A seam consists of
                pixels connected together across the image, either horizontally or
                vertically; 3) removing all of the pixels along the vertical
                or horizontal seam.

            </li>
            <p> <strong>Goal:</strong> Implement the Burrows-Wheeler algorithm for
                data compression, which presently forms the basis of the Unix compression
                utility bzip2.</p>
            <p> <strong>Details:</strong> The Burrows-Wheeler data compression algorithm
                consists of three algorithmic components, which are applied in succession: 1)
                Burrows-Wheeler transform, which transforms a typical English text file into
                a file in which sequences of the same character occur near each other many times.
                2) Move-to-front encoding, which converts the processed text file from step 1
                into a file in which certain characters appear much more frequently than others.
                3) Huffman compression- compresses the processed file from step 2 by encoding
                frequently occurring characters with short codewords and infrequently occurring
                characters with long codewords. I implemented the first two steps. Step 1 and 2
                make the huffman compression particularly effective because they produce a text
                file in which certain characters appear much more frequently than others.</p>

            </li>
            <p> <strong> Goal: </strong> Implement details of the "de-commenting" task
                of the C preprocessor to better understand how it works.</p>
            <p> <strong> Details:</strong> Using a DFA designed with the required logic
                for all of the various functionalities and conditions that the program should
                take into consideration after reading each character from stdin
                from a given text file, this de-commenting
                program replaces comments (text outside string and character
                literals) with a space character and newline characters as originally found
                in the comment in order to preserve line numbering. Returns 0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)
                if there are no unterminated comments;
                otherwise returns EXIT_FAILURE with an error message to stderr.</p>

            </li>
            <p> <b>Goal:</b> Use arrays, pointers, and stateless modules in C; utilize the
                "design by contract" style of programming; use the Linux
                operating system and the GNU programming tools, especially
                bash, emacs and gdb.
            </p>
            <p> <b> Details:</b> Composed a str module containing versions
                of the most commonly used standard string handling functions
                in the C language. Specifically, designed an str module that
                contains these functions, each of which behaves the same
                as the corresponding standard C functions: strlen, strcpy,
                strcat, strcmp, and strstr.

            </li>
            <p> <b> Goal:</b> Use dynamic memory management to create abstract
                data types (ADTs) in C, and gain more experience with
                the Linux operating system and the GNU programming tools,
                such as bash, gdb and make.</p>
            <p> <b> Details:</b> Implement two versions of a symbol table (an unordered
                collection of bindings), one using arrays and another using linked lists.
                A binding consists of a key and a value.
                A key is a string that uniquely identifies its binding; a value is
                data that is somehow pertinent to its key. A symbol table allows its
                client to insert (put) new bindings, to retrive (get) the values of
                bindings with specified keys, and to remove bindings with specified keys.
                Symbol tables are used often in programming systems; compilers, assemblers,
                and execution profilers use them extensively. </p>

            <p> <b> Goal:</b> The purpose of this project was: </p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li> To read substantial amounts of code that I
                    did not write and to get up to speed on the codebase
                    quickly.
                </li>
                <li> To debug with a structured, systematic approach. </li>
                <li> To design thorough internal testing, particularly
                    relating to representation invariants of a datatype
                    (i.e., the characteristics of the internal state of a
                    data structure that result in invalid instances of it).
                </li>
                <li> To create new implementations for a given interface
                    and making sensible design decisions about program
                    structure and modularity.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p> <b> Details:</b> For the last portion of this project, I
                created a new implementation for the given interface. This new
                implementation consisted of expanding upon the directory tree (DT) interface
                to a file tree (FT). FT is an extension of a DT in which leaves may now
                represent either an empty directory or a file. The difference between a
                file and a directory is that a file can contain data of any type and
                cannot have any child nodes, while a directory cannot have data but can
                have child nodes. The root is the only directory node that has no parent.</p>
